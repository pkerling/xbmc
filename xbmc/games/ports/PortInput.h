   * \brief Monitors for keymap actions in the background during gameplay
   *
   * This class inherits from the default controller that Kodi uses for
   * normal input. However, it overrides some functions of CDefaultJoystick
   * to customize the input handling behavior:
   *
   *   - GetWindowID():
   *         This forces the keymap handler to use the FullscreenGame window
   *
   *   - GetFallthrough():
   *         This prevents the keymap handler from falling through to
   *         FullscreenVideo or the global keymap when looking up keys.
   *
   * This class is registered as a promiscuous input handler, so it receives
   * all input but doesn't block any handled input from reaching the game
   * client.
